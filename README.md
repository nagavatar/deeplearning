# deeplearning

initially there is simple matrix of rolling dice and sum of two rolling dice
the nthere is the first model I have created of deep learning using basic neural n/w which predicts digit from 0 to 9
I have used ADAM as the optimiser and loss function as SPARSE_CATEGORICAL_CROSSENTROPY


created the same model using 3 ways I have learnt
sequential API
sequential API using tf.add function
Functional API as it let us build much more complex data

SUMMARY OF MODEL
BUILD-->COMPILE-->TRAIN-->EVALUATE-->PREDICTION
